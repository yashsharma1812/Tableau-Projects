# Student Onboarding Analysis Dashboard 

## Overview

This repository contains a Tableau dashboard focusing on the analysis of student onboarding experience using an e-learning platform. The goal is to provide stakeholders with valuable insights into students' discovery of the platform, learning aspirations, and career goals. The dashboard utilizes interactive filters for dynamic data exploration.

## Dashboard Features

- **Monthly Survey Response and Completion Rate:**
  - Explore trends in survey response and completion rates on a monthly basis.

- **Survey Completion Rate by Country:**
  - Analyze the completion rates of surveys across different countries.

- **Source of Platform Discovery:**
  - Investigate where students commonly hear about the data science platform.

- **Student Goals:**
  - Identify the percentage of students aspiring to become data scientists.

- **Desired Learning Areas:**
  - Visualize the primary and least desired learning areas among students.

## Interactive Filters

The dashboard incorporates several interactive filters, enabling users to slice and dice the data based on the following variables:

- Registration Date
- Survey Completion Date
- Student Country
- Subscription Status and Type

These filters provide a dynamic and robust tool for stakeholders to derive meaningful insights from the onboarding survey data.

## Interpretation from the Analysis:

Student Profile: From our analysis, most onboarded students are new to the data science learning world and wish to learn about data analysis and visualization and improve their programming skills. The channel of acquisition that brought in the most students is YouTube, where we often put out tutorials or career-related video content. These topics are well suited for those who wish to enter the data science world and understand the job market and opportunities better or want to hone their data science skills with hands-on practical videos.
Upon examining the map, it becomes evident that the largest group that has completed the survey hails from the US, closely followed by India. These two nations collectively represent nearly half of all participating students. The findings are logical given that US and India are highly populated countries. 

Consider the following two primary insights upon which we can take action.

1. Content Curation: Ensure the platform's content aligns with students' intended learning objectives—encompassing introductory and advanced data science courses where students can explore the field, its associated positions, and roles.  
Courses on data analysis using different tools (e.g., Python and SQL) and data visualization software (e.g., Tableau and PowerBI) will be needed. Moreover, offering students a natural progression and learning path into the data science realm is essential. This will include adding more advanced courses in Machine Learning, for example, and adding projects where students can practice the skills they acquired by completing the courses.

2. Channel of Acquisition: Because YouTube is the largest acquisition channel, we can devise a reach-out strategy where we upload introductory data science videos and tutorials from our platform. That way, we can reach a larger group interested in learning more about data science and data analysis. Moreover, suppose a YouTube video is paid for. In that case, it can reach out to many more people across the US and India, for example, and reach a wider audience of data science beginners—something our platform is well suited for.

These are just a few key observations we can deduce from this data. Furthermore, this analysis can serve both the content creation and marketing teams. It can also give a general direction for developing the platform and serving the needs of its students.
